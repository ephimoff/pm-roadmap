# Product

Product starts from the **Vision**. The Product Vision is a _representation of what the product will be in the end_. Then goes the **Mission**. A company Mission is very important and addresses _why the company exists and what it is trying to achieve_. Mission is being born during the discussion with company's top-management. Mission helps to set the **Goals** for the company and the Product. Goals are, simply put, key checkpoints with data indicators. They help to understand whether you are going in the right direction towards the mission and how fast you are moving. We can break the goals into the **Tasks** that describe how we are going to achieve the goals. Finally, **Product Strategy** is a path or a plan for achieving the goals.

Depending on which level of hierarchy you work you get to work on one or more of these aspects. For example, if you are a CPO, there is a big chance that you will start with the Vision. Junior PMs will most likely work on executing and enriching their company or department's Product Strategy
