# How to contribute

## How you can participate in the Roadmap

- [ðŸ’¡ Create issues](https://github.com/ephimoff/pm-roadmap/issues/new/choose) if you see that we didn't cover some important area for a PM. Or, there is a mistake/typo in the description. Or, you have got a great idea for a discussion.
- [ðŸ”§ Send a PR](https://github.com/ephimoff/pm-roadmap/pulls) with the correction of the actual mistakes
- [ðŸ“š Update the knowledge base](/guide/contribution.html#adding-or-updating-data) with additional sections/areas for a PM

If you don't how exactly to help you can have a look at our [list of issues](https://github.com/ephimoff/pm-roadmap/issues).
You can also start working on a description for one of the competencies. To avoid any duplication of the work use this checklist:

1. Check on the board that this task is not 'In progress'

1. Find that ticket in the [`knowledge-base` labels](TODO:add-a-link) list and assign it to yourself and move it to 'In progress'

1. Read [Accepting the changes](/guide/contribution.html#adding-or-updating-data)

1. Send us a PR
