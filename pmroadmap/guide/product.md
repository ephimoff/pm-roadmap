# Product

Product starts from the **Vision**. The Product Vision is a _representation of what the product will be in the end_. Then goes the **Mission**. A company Mission is very important and addresses _why the company exists and what it is trying to achieve_. Mission is being born during the discussion with company's top-management. Mission helps to set the **Goals** for the company and the Product. Goals are, simply put, key checkpoints with data indicators. They help to understand whether you are going in the right direction towards the mission and how fast you are moving. We can break the goals into the **Tasks** that describe how we are going to achieve the goals. Finally, **Product Strategy** is a path or a plan for achieving the goals.

Depending on which level of hierarchy you work you get to work on one or more of these aspects. For example, if you are a CPO, there is a big chance that you will start with the Vision. Junior PMs will most likely work on executing and enriching their company or department's Product Strategy

## Product Vision

The product vision is the overarching goal you are aiming for, the reason for creating the product. It provides a continued purpose in an ever-changing world, acts as the product's true north, provides motivation when the going gets tough, and facilitates effective collaboration.

### How to create a Product Vision

One of the ways to start a new Product Vision is to use a Product Vision canvas and populate it with the data:

#### Product vision for X

- What's your motivation for creating the product?
- Which positive change should it bring about?
  | Target group | Needs | Product | Business goals |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | Which market or the market segment does the product address? | What problems does the product solve? | What product is it? | How is the product going to benefit the company? |
  | Who are the target customers and users? | Which benefit does it provide? | What makes it stand out? | What are the business goals? |
  | | | Is it feasible to develop the product? | |
