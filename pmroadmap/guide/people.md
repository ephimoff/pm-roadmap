# People

We cannot work in a vacuum. Working with people is one of the key aspects of a job for a Product Manager. It includes working with your stakeholders, your development teams, your users. Building people skills is important and here we want to help you with that.

## Work with partners

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are your business partners. They might be complicated, non-techy and speak a different language (not literally) but they know their area very well and have a similar goal in mind - for your product to succeed. So, you will need to learn how to respect them and how to collaborate with them efficiently.

The key to success in Stakeholders Management is **communication**. Keeping your stakeholders in the loop, getting constant feedback from them will allow you to ace this part of your job. When dealing with stakeholders there is no such thing as over-communication. Try to document everything: meeting minutes, decisions made via phone/call/zoom; send notes; publish wiki/confluence pages. Make all decisions and pivotal points a common knowledge and publicly (within your company) available.

If something comes up - notify your SHs, document it somewhere: who, what, when. Later, should a question about it arises, just point to that documentation piece. The same goes for the stakeholders' feedback: just put it somewhere. It will help you to reflect and use it in future more efficiently.

Communication skill is a very hard skill to develop but it's a useful one.
